This study aimed to quantify the effect of obesity on the risk of developing diabetes throughout the life-course, as well as the lifetime healtcare costs associated with the disease. Data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey were used. We found that class III obese individuals had a six-fold higher risk of developing diabetes. compared to normal-weight individuals. We also concluded that obesity was associated with substantial economic burden. My role in this project was to assisist the first author in performing regression analyses on the survey data using STATA, as well as manuscript revision.
